# Bat vs Rat Behaviour Analysis – HIT140 Assessment 3

## Project Overview
This project explores the behaviour of Egyptian fruit bats and black rats using observational data collected from field studies. It aims to understand how environmental conditions, competition, and resource availability influence risk-taking, foraging behaviour, and activity patterns.  
We apply data science techniques to analyse the dataset, generate visualisations, and build predictive models to better understand behavioural outcomes.

## Project Structure

```
bat_rat_project/
│
├─ main.py                  # Main entry point – runs the full analysis pipeline (loads data, calls EDA, modelling, and saves results)
├─ utils.py                 # Data cleaning and feature processing functions – handles data formatting, conversions, and season classification
├─ eda.py                   # Exploratory Data Analysis – generates visualisations, summary statistics, and correlation analysis
├─ models.py               #  Statistical tests and predictive modelling – performs chi-square, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal tests, and builds ML models
│
├─ dataset1(1).csv         # Bat behaviour dataset (risk, reward, time, season data)
├─ dataset2(1).csv         # Rat activity dataset (arrivals, food availability, timing)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Mac/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the main analysis script**:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will automatically:
- Load and clean the datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Generate all visualisations into the `figures/` folder
- Save a quick metrics summary and JSON output

---

## Outputs & Results

- **EDA Visualisations:** Bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmap showing behavioural trends.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests used for comparisons.  
- **Predictive Models:** Logistic Regression and Random Forest for classification; Poisson and Linear Regression for predicting rat arrivals.  
- **Summary Files:** `quick_metrics.txt` and `eda_summary.json` contain key results and metrics.

---

## Key Insights

- Bats take more risks during the **dry season (~57%)** compared to the wet season (~49%).  
- Rewards show seasonal variation and are generally higher when food availability increases.  
- Rat arrivals peak between **3–5 hours after sunset** and show a positive correlation with food availability.  
- Predictive models achieved ~0.99 accuracy (classification) and an R² of ~0.38–0.42 (regression).

## Troubleshooting

- **Module errors:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install missing libraries.  
- **No plots shown:** Check the `figures/` folder — all graphs are saved there automatically.  
- **File errors:** Ensure CSV files are named correctly and are in the same folder as `main.py`.
